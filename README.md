# Company-Profile-Builder-

This app uses node.js to build profiles for a company team. When the user opens node.js in the terminal, they are prompted with a series of questions about the 
members of that company. There can be only one manager per team but the user can add as many engineers or interns as they want. Once the user is done filling
out the team's information, an HTML will be generated with the user's input of the team's information. When open to a browser, the team's information will be 
display and organized.
